#   Overview

Biblioperson is a system designed to manage, analyze, and provide advanced search capabilities over personal knowledge from various platforms and document formats. It addresses the problem of fragmented information by centralizing content and enabling users to gain deeper insights, discover connections, and generate new content.

#   Core Features

-   **Import Content from Multiple Sources:**
    -   What it does: Imports content from diverse sources, including DOCX, PDF, TXT, MD, EXCEL, CSV, XML, HTML,  and JSON files, as well as data from social media.
    -   Why it's important: Consolidates information, eliminating the need to search across multiple platforms and formats.
    -   How it works: ETL scripts in the `dataset/` directory process and convert files into a standardized NDJSON format, preserving key metadata. The ingestion process is designed to be modular and extensible, using loaders, segmenters, post-processors, and exporters.

-   **Modular Document Processing:**
    -   What it does: Employs a modular pipeline for processing documents, allowing for flexible configuration and adaptation to different content types.
    -   Why it's important: Improves the accuracy of content segmentation and enhances the system's ability to handle various document structures.
    -   How it works: The pipeline consists of loaders (extract content), segmenters (define semantic units), post-processors (filter and enrich), and exporters (serialize data). Perfiles (profiles) defined in YAML files control the behavior of this pipeline.

-   **Semantic Search and Analysis:**
    -   What it does: Enables users to search and analyze content using both full-text and semantic search capabilities.
    -   Why it's important: Semantic search allows users to find information based on meaning and context, not just keywords.
    -   How it works: The backend uses Meilisearch for efficient search and `sentence-transformers` for generating embeddings to support semantic queries. The frontend provides tools for exploring content by topics, dates, authors, and sources.

-   **Content Generation Assistance:**
    -   What it does: Assists users in generating new content based on the analysis of existing documents.
    -   Why it's important: Facilitates the creation of relevant and engaging content by leveraging the user's knowledge base.
    -   How it works: (Future Enhancement) The system will analyze existing content to suggest topics, styles, and relevant information for new content.

#   User Experience

-   **User Personas:**
    -   Knowledge Workers: Researchers, analysts, and writers who need to manage and analyze large volumes of text.
    -   Content Creators: Social media managers, Youtubers, influencers, bloggers, and marketers who want to generate new content efficiently from existing knowledge.
    -   Personal Knowledge Managers: Individuals who want to organize and explore their personal notes, documents, and digital information.

-   **Key User Flows:**
    -   Import and Organize: Users import content, which the system processes and stores in a structured format.
    -   Search and Discover: Users search for information using keywords or semantic queries and explore the results.
    -   Analyze and Generate: Users analyze content to gain insights and use the system to assist in generating new content.

-   **UI/UX Considerations:**
    -   Intuitive Interface: User-friendly design for easy navigation and interaction.
    -   Clear Search Results: Presentation of search results in a clear and organized manner.
    -   Advanced Search Options: Filters and sorting options to refine search queries.
    -   Content Visualization: Tools for visualizing content relationships and trends.

#   Technical Architecture

-   **System Components:**
    -   Frontend: React SPA for the user interface.
    -   Backend: Flask API for handling requests and business logic.
    -   Database: SQLite for storing content, metadata, and embeddings.
    -   Search Engine: Meilisearch for full-text and semantic search.
    -   ETL Pipeline: Python scripts for data ingestion and processing.
    -   Dataset: The collection of scripts, data structures, and processes that constitute the ETL Pipeline. It encompasses data loading, conversion, segmentation, normalization, and preparation for database ingestion.

-   **Data Models:**
    -   `content`: Stores the processed text content and associated metadata.
    -   `content_embeddings`: Stores vector embeddings of the text.

-   **APIs and Integrations:**
    -   REST API: Flask exposes endpoints for the frontend to interact with the backend.
    -   Meilisearch API: Backend communicates with Meilisearch for search functionality.

-   **Infrastructure Requirements:**
    -   Python 3.8+
    -   Node.js 16+
    -   SQLite
    -   Meilisearch
    -   Web Browser
