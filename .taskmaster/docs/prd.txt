# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - BiblioPersona

Biblioperson is a conversational AI system that allows users to interact with authors through an intelligent chatbot interface. The system enables users to have conversations with specific authors based on their uploaded works, generate social media content in the author's style, and become authors themselves by uploading their own documents. It addresses the problem of fragmented knowledge by creating a centralized, conversational interface where users can directly "speak" with authors and leverage their knowledge for content creation.

#   Core Features

-   **Conversational Author Interaction:**
    -   What it does: Enables users to have natural conversations with authors through an AI chatbot that responds in the author's voice and style based on their uploaded works.
    -   Why it's important: Provides direct access to author knowledge and perspectives, making information discovery more intuitive and engaging.
    -   How it works: The system uses the author's processed documents as context for LLM prompts, allowing the AI to respond as if it were the author, drawing from their actual written content.

-   **Social Media Content Generation:**
    -   What it does: Generates posts, tweets, and other social media content in the style of specific authors based on their knowledge and writing patterns.
    -   Why it's important: Helps content creators produce authentic, author-inspired content for social media platforms.
    -   How it works: Uses author-specific prompts and templates combined with the author's knowledge base to generate content that matches their voice and expertise.

-   **User-as-Author System:**
    -   What it does: Allows users to upload their own documents and become queryable authors within the system.
    -   Why it's important: Enables users to create their own AI persona that others can interact with, expanding the knowledge base organically.
    -   How it works: User-uploaded documents are processed through the same pipeline as other authors, creating a conversational AI version of the user that can be queried by others.

-   **Import Content from Multiple Sources:**
    -   What it does: Imports content from diverse sources, including DOCX, PDF, TXT, MD, EXCEL, CSV, XML, HTML, and JSON files to build author knowledge bases.
    -   Why it's important: Consolidates author knowledge from various document formats into a unified conversational interface.
    -   How it works: ETL scripts in the `dataset/` directory process and convert files into a standardized NDJSON format, preserving key metadata for contextual conversations.

-   **Modular Document Processing:**
    -   What it does: Employs a modular pipeline for processing documents, allowing for flexible configuration and adaptation to different content types and author styles.
    -   Why it's important: Improves the accuracy of content segmentation and enhances the system's ability to capture author voice and knowledge patterns.
    -   How it works: The pipeline consists of loaders (extract content), segmenters (define semantic units), post-processors (filter and enrich), and exporters (serialize data). Profiles defined in YAML files control the behavior of this pipeline.

-   **Contextual Search and Knowledge Retrieval:**
    -   What it does: Provides the chatbot with relevant context from the author's knowledge base to generate accurate, contextual responses.
    -   Why it's important: Ensures that conversations are grounded in the author's actual knowledge and writings rather than generic AI responses.
    -   How it works: The backend uses Meilisearch for efficient search and `sentence-transformers` for generating embeddings to support semantic context retrieval for chatbot responses.

-   **Digital Library Interface:**
    -   What it does: Provides a comprehensive library view where users can browse their uploaded books with visual book covers, progress tracking, organizational tools, and dedicated annotation management sections.
    -   Why it's important: Creates an intuitive, book-like experience that makes digital reading and content management feel natural and engaging while providing powerful annotation tools.
    -   How it works: Books are displayed as visual covers (with random colors when no cover exists), showing title, author, reading progress bar, and read/unread status. Users can filter by author, language, tags, and favorites. The library includes dedicated sections for Annotations/Notebooks where users can access all their annotation notebooks for each content piece.

-   **Ebook Reconstruction System:**
    -   What it does: Intelligently reconstructs uploaded content into navigable ebook format with proper pagination, preserving the original structure while enabling seamless page-by-page reading.
    -   Why it's important: Transforms processed documents back into readable book format, maintaining the natural reading flow users expect from traditional books.
    -   How it works: The system analyzes segmented content and reconstructs it into paginated format, maintaining chapter breaks, proper text flow, and visual hierarchy. Users can click any content in their library to open it as a reconstructed ebook.

-   **Immersive Reading Experience with Multi-Color Highlighting:**
    -   What it does: Enables users to read books in a paginated, book-like format with advanced annotation and multi-color highlighting capabilities for organizing different types of information.
    -   Why it's important: Provides a distraction-free reading experience that mimics physical books while adding digital advantages like searchable annotations and color-coded highlighting systems.
    -   How it works: Books open in a paginated reader where users can select text and highlight it with different colors (yellow, green, blue, pink, etc.). Each highlight automatically creates entries in the book's annotation notebook. Users can navigate between pages and all highlights are preserved and searchable.

-   **Advanced Annotation and Notebook System:**
    -   What it does: Provides sophisticated annotation capabilities including page-specific annotations, personal notebooks for each content, and the ability to create original content within annotation notebooks.
    -   Why it's important: Enables deep engagement with content through organized note-taking, personal reflections, and content creation directly linked to source material.
    -   How it works: Each book has an associated annotation notebook with sections for "Page Annotations" showing all highlights and notes. Users can write original content, thoughts, and analysis within these notebooks. All annotations include page references and can be searched and organized.

-   **Cross-Content Reference System:**
    -   What it does: Allows users to create intelligent references between different contents using "@" syntax, enabling seamless navigation and content linking across the entire library.
    -   Why it's important: Creates a web of knowledge where insights from one book can be connected to others, building a personalized knowledge graph.
    -   How it works: Within annotation notebooks, users can type "@content_name" to reference other books or "@content_name#123" to reference specific segments. On desktop, hovering shows a preview modal with the referenced content; on mobile, tapping opens the preview. Clicking references navigates directly to the referenced content or specific location.

-   **Author-Centric Views:**
    -   What it does: Provides dedicated author pages that display all content from specific authors, enabling users to explore an author's complete works within their library.
    -   Why it's important: Allows users to study authors comprehensively and see connections across their different works.
    -   How it works: Users can click on any author name to view a dedicated author page showing all books, articles, and content by that author, along with aggregated statistics and reading progress across all their works.

-   **Content Metadata Editor:**
    -   What it does: Allows users to edit and manage metadata for any content including title, author, language, tags, and other bibliographic information.
    -   Why it's important: Enables users to maintain accurate, organized library data and correct any import errors or missing information.
    -   How it works: Users can access an edit mode for any content where they can modify title, author, language, publication date, and custom tags. When editing an author name, if the new author doesn't exist, the system automatically creates a new author entry. Changes are immediately reflected across the library and search systems.

-   **Advanced Content Management:**
    -   What it does: Allows users to organize, tag, and manage their digital library with favorites, categories, and the ability to remove content while maintaining annotation data integrity.
    -   Why it's important: Enables users to maintain a curated, organized library that grows with their needs while providing easy content removal when needed.
    -   How it works: Users can create custom tags, mark books as favorites, categorize content, and permanently remove books from both the database and file system when no longer needed. The system handles cascading deletion of associated annotations and references.

-   **Personal Author Profiles:**
    -   What it does: Transforms users into queryable authors when they upload their own documents, creating a bidirectional knowledge sharing system.
    -   Why it's important: Expands the knowledge base organically and allows users to share their expertise through the conversational AI interface.
    -   How it works: User-uploaded documents are processed to create an AI persona that others can interact with, while the user maintains control over their author profile and content visibility.
